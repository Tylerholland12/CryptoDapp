<br>
<br>
A decentralized platform that is able to buy and sell ethereum between users. It is intended to have a single platform that a user can come to rather than multiple to manage their personal cryptocurrency. There are already multiple websites that let a user purhcase and trade cryptocurrency, but with this it is intended to be user-to-user where at least one of the users has some amount of cryptocurrency and can give to another person.
